## Statue of Liberty

![Statue](public/images/liberty.jpg)

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,<br>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;<br>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand<br>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame<br>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name<br>
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand<br>
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command<br>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.<br>
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she<br>
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,<br>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,<br>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
